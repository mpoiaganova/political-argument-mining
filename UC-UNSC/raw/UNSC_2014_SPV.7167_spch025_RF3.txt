I did not want to say that a lie cannot only be a distortion of facts, but also a selective interpretation of one's own position. That is what we have just heard from my American colleague. What we have heard from Washington, DC, and the way it was heard clearly demonstrated to all - including to those in Kyiv, which is most important - that the United States looked favourably on the forceful change of power, which did not ultimately serve the interests of the Ukrainian people.

Regarding my proposal. 1 do think it would be good to conclude this meeting with such a statement, not asking every delegation what it is going to declare but rather make ajoint statement calling for a swift halt to all violence. including the use of military force in the cast of the country, and for seriously taking up the full implementation of the Geneva document.
