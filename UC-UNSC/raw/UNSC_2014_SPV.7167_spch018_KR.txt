I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea.

I thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.

The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned about the continuing tensions in eastern Ukraine. Despite the agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation in Ukraine is showing no signs of abating. We are particularly alarmed by the fresh violence that erupted in Sloviansk over night, including violent attacks targeting two Government helicopters by illegal armed groups. We strongly condemn those attacks, which resulted in the death of two Ukrainians. Such instances point to a serious deterioration in the situation. All provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately.

In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful solution. In that regard, we call for all parties to the Geneva statement to implement their commitments.
We also fully support the Secretary-General's good offices and diplomatic initiatives. We hope that Under-Secretary-General Feltman's upcoming visit to Ukraine and Russia will contribute to a de-escalating of tensions on the ground.

With the important elections scheduled in May, it is still all the more important to ensure the environment is conducive to fair and free elections in the country without any intervention or influence by outside forces.
We hope that the Ukrainian Government will lead a inclusive and transparent constitutional process.

We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.

I resume now my functions as President of the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.
