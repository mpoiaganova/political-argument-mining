373,"Finally, Mr. Yatsenyuk came, said something and left.",premise,[378],{}
374,Then Mr. Turchynov came the next day and did not seem to agree with him.,premise,[379],{}
375,It seemed they preferred to use force.,claim,[380],{}
376,"Incidentally, some very worrying tones have crept into our numerous contacts with our Western colleagues.",non-arg,[],{}
377,"As the Council knows, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, has been talking to Secretary of State Kerry on the phone almost every day.",premise,[381],{}
378,"Kerry continually claims to understand our concern that in contacts with the Ukrainian authorities genuine efforts should be made to ensure that they demonstrate a better grasp of the concerns of the south-eastern regions of Ukraine regarding a definition of their autonomy, independence and language rights.",premise,[382],{}
379,"And then suddenly one ofthe United States Deputy Secretaries of State gets up in Congress and says, we know that these talks will not lead anywhere, but we have to occupy the time somehow.",claim,[383],{}
380,"""Occupy the time."" So, really, maybe somebody in Washington, DC, is thinking about Turchynov's military offensive scenario.",premise,"[384, 385]",{}
381,"In which case, there is no need to accuse Russia of attempting destabilization.",claim,[386],{}
382,"The representative of the United States noted that Vice-President Biden will be going to Ukraine, it seems, on 21 April.",premise,[387],{}
383,But maybe he should not wait for 21 April.,premise,[388],{}
384,Maybe he should go right now.,claim,[389],{}
385,"Pick up the phone, call Mr. Turchynov - as he called President Yanukovych more than once before 21 February - and say to him what he said to Mr. Yanukovych.",premise,[390],{}
386,"As we were informed by the Vice-President's Chief of Staff, he said, ""For God's sake, just do not use force.",premise,[391],{}
387,"Call off your forces from the centre of Kyiv"".",premise,[392],{}
388,That was what Mr. Biden said.,non-arg,[],{}
389,"And now, is the United States going to encourage the fulfilment of this criminal decree authorizing the use of military force?",premise,[393],{}
390,"Why, in one case, when it was a question of preparations to storm the residence of the President of Ukraine, the call was that under no circumstances should force be used, while in the current situation, it is to encourage the insane military actions that Turchynov's decree talks about?",claim,[394],{}
391,I would therefore request Ms.,non-arg,[],{}
392,"Power to ask Vice-President Biden to call Mr. Turchynov right now, because in a few hours' time things might take an irreversible turn.",premise,"[395, 396]","{(395, 396): 'support'}"
393,Many colleagues mentioned the meeting that was announced for 17 April.,non-arg,[],{}
394,"Indeed, for some months now, in particular during the period after 21 February, we have constantly encouraged such formats for dialogue as a possible way to achieve a solution to the crisis.",claim,"[397, 398]","{(398, 399): 'support', (398, 397): 'support'}"
395,"We agreed in principle that the meeting would take place among the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Secretary of State Kerry, Ms.",premise,[399],{}
396,Ashton and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.,non-arg,[],{}
397,We very much hope that such a high-level meeting will encourage a broad political dialogue in Ukraine and show the way towards a political solution to the crisis.,claim,[400],{}
398,But what does the Council think?,non-arg,[],{}
399,"If armed force is used and hostilities take place tomorrow, are we really going to sign off on that meeting?",premise,[401],{}
400,"Of course, that initiative is going to be fundamentally undermined if military operations are commenced in south-eastern Ukraine.",claim,[402],{}
401,"Please, let us refrain from any accusations or speculation as to why Russia is trying to do what it is doing.",claim,[403],{}
402,Let us focus our attention on what we can actually do in this case.,claim,[404],{}
403,Here I am speaking to my Western colleagues.,non-arg,[],{}
404,"Let us ensure that we do not permit the Ukrainian authorities to commit the reckless actions that are currently enshrined in the criminal decree by Mr. Turchynov, and let us stop that decree from being implemented.",claim,"[405, 406]","{(405, 407): 'support', (406, 407): 'support'}"
405,"That would have extremely significant consequences, first and foremost for the people of Ukraine, of course.",premise,[407],{}
406,That needs to be avoided.,claim,[408],{}
407,"I will be brief, but in response to my colleague from the Russian Federation, I would like to say just a few things.",non-arg,[],{}
408,"First, the United States has constantly called for de-escalation and urged restraint.",claim,[409],{}
409,That has been our consistent policy.,claim,[410],{}
410,"Our consistent statements have made clear that military force is not the answer, and we have commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more than probably any country in the United Nations could or would endure without using force.",premise,[411],{}
411,"Therefore, there have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy.",claim,[412],{}
412,"Secondly, it is not the United States that has escalated the situation, it is the Russian Federation.",claim,[413],{}
413,"Thirdly, while we would like to place our faith in talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union and Ukraine, it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian Federation and the military actions of the Russian Federation - which range from the massing of 40,000 troops on the border to the subversive activities inside Ukraine - with their appeal for diplomacy and de-escalation.",claim,[414],{}
414,It is an appeal that we wish were in fact sincere.,non-arg,[],{}
415,"Fourthly, a few times, the representative of the Russian Federation has described what is happening in the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations.",premise,[415],{}
416,I would refer back to my French colleague's comment that those claims are rooted in some idea that the Internet does not exist and that people cannot see for themselves that they are not protests and they are not demonstrations.,claim,[416],{}
417,"They are professional forces carrying weapons - Russian-made weapons, as it happens - and carrying out sophisticated, coordinated military operations across a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities.",premise,[417],{}
418,They are not demonstrations.,claim,[418],{}
419,They are not protests.,claim,[419],{}
420,They are military operations.,claim,[420],{}
421,"Finally, the credibility of the Russian Federation has been gravely undermined.",claim,[421],{}
422,"That said, we remain eager and willing to talk about how to de-escalate the situation.",non-arg,[],{}
423,"That will require that the Russian Federation pull back its forces, which are ominously stationed and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border.",claim,[422],{}
424,It will require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate the situation in the light of the armed takeover of those buildings.,claim,[423],{}
425,"If, in fact, the Russian Federation is interested in peace and in upholding its role as an enforcer of international peace and security, then it will engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of conviction, urgency and truthfulness than it has up to this point.",claim,[424],{}
426,Several issues were raised by our Russian colleague.,non-arg,[],{}
427,I would like to answer just one.,non-arg,[],{}
428,"(spoke in Russian) First, Mr. Churkin compared the situation in December and January with the current situation.",premise,[425],{}
429,"We must recall that, at that time, the people were speaking out against the banditry of the authorities, and now it is bandits who are against the people.",premise,[426],{}
430,There is a difference there.,claim,[427],{}
431,We cannot remain calm about the fact that several hundred separatists are holding thousands of people hostage to fear in towns.,premise,[428],{}
432,"We see the standoffs on television in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk.",premise,[429],{}
433,"We cannot look on while small groups of armed people, headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons to hand out.",premise,[430],{}
434,"Indeed, those are terrorist operations that have been specially organized and orchestrated.",claim,[431],{}
435,"Mr. Churkin is absolutely right, there is not much time left at all, there is just about an hour and a half.",premise,[432],{}
436,"It is just as easy for him to call his President and say a few simple things to him as it is for me to do so, so I will repeat them here.",claim,[433],{}
437,"The statement that Mr. Churkin has referred very negatively to several times today was made by the acting President, Mr. Turchynov, and was addressed to those people who are now creating tension in those towns, the terrorist groups of separatists.",non-arg,[],{}
438,"He stated: (spoke in English) ""Those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers and who will surrender their weapons and leave State administrative buildings will be released from prosecution."" (spoke in Russian) Why do they not call their people and tell them to come back, sit down around the negotiating table and decide together how we can establish good neighbourly relations?",premise,[434],{}
439,That would be the right thing to do.,claim,[435],{}
440,"The Government mentioned the referendum, changes to the Constitution, the retention of the language law and the fact that the problems that have cropped up over the decades and remained unsolved by previous Governments needed to be addressed at last.",premise,[436],{}
441,"That is something that we need to do, but we are being prevented from doing so.",claim,[437],{}
442,I would like Mr. Churkin to listen to that and convey what he can to his Government.,non-arg,[],{}
443,(spoke in English) I am sincerely thankful to the members of the Security Council who spoke in favour of a peaceful resolution of the problems in Ukraine.,non-arg,[],{}
444,I am sincerely thankful for that.,non-arg,[],{}
445,I also thank the members of the Security Council for understanding the critical situation in Ukraine and for any kind of support they can provide.,non-arg,[],{}
446,I shall not take up much ofthe Council's time.,non-arg,[],{}
447,I should just like to say two things.,non-arg,[],{}
448,"First, the representative of Ukraine is far too easy in characterizing his own people as bandits.",claim,[438],{}
449,The Right Sector and those who say the demonstrators should be killed are not bandits; they are simply the political elite of Kyiv.,claim,[439],{}
450,Are not those who are protesting in eastern Ukraine able to do so without Russia's say-so?,non-arg,[],{}
451,Do they need Russia to say that events in Kyiv are unacceptable before they are able to grasp that?,non-arg,[],{}
452,When radicals come to tell the miners of that region that they will establish their own order - surely the miners can understand that without a hint from Russia?,non-arg,[],{}
453,Are the protesters able to understand how bad things have become only when Russian agents come to explain the situation to them?,non-arg,[],{}
454,Do their own life experience and understanding of the situation in their own country count for nothing?,non-arg,[],{}
455,How will those things influence them?,non-arg,[],{}
456,"Secondly, with regard to the statement made by my American colleague Ms.",non-arg,[],{}
457,"Power, she did not mention her view on the decree to use armed force in eastern Ukraine.",non-arg,[],{}
458,"I hope that, as the Ukrainian representative has called for, following today's discussion some Western colleagues and partners will pick up the telephone and call their leaders and those in Kyiv with whom they enjoy influence, who may not act unless they get the green light from Western capitals.",claim,[440],{}
459,I would ask my colleagues to give them the red light and tell them that problems can be resolved through dialogue and not military confrontation.,non-arg,[],{}
460,I am grateful to Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.,non-arg,[],{}
461,The United Kingdom requested this meeting because we are deeply concerned by the deteriorating security situation in southern and eastern Ukraine and by the fact that the Geneva agreement of 17 April is not yet achieving its objective to restore stability in Ukraine.,premise,"[441, 442]","{(441, 442): 'support'}"
462,It is vitally important that the Security Council maintain its close scrutiny of events in Ukraine and the consequent threat to international peace and security.,claim,[443],{}
463,We will doubtless hear Russian claims that it is the actions of the Ukrainian Government that are destabilizing the south and east of the country.,premise,[444],{}
464,"In fact, it is Russia that has taken further dangerous steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine.",claim,[445],{}
465,"It has directed paramilitary actions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Lugansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine.",premise,[446],{}
466,Russian military jets and helicopters have made incursions into Ukrainian airspace.,premise,[447],{}
467,Russian armed forces have held further military exercises on Ukraine's border.,premise,[448],{}
468,These are all clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine.,claim,[449],{}
469,These steps have been matched with intensified rhetoric.,claim,[450],{}
470,The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation has asserted that Russia has a legal basis to intervene in Ukraine in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.,premise,[451],{}
471,This is a claim that takes Russia's distortion of international law to a new level.,premise,[452],{}
472,There is no justification or legal basis whatsoever for invoking Article 51.,claim,[453],{}
473,"Russian nationals are not under threat in Ukraine - a fact that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions, including by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission and by the Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).",premise,"[454, 455]","{(454, 455): 'support'}"
474,This is deeply irresponsible rhetoric intended to threaten and intimidate the Ukrainian Government and provide a bogus pretext for further illegal breaches of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.,claim,[456],{}
475,"As a result of Russia's activities, there has been a further marked deterioration in the security situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, as Mr. Feltman has just said.",premise,[457],{}
476,The United Kingdom condemns the abduction at gunpoint and public parading of an OSCE Vienna Document inspection team and its Ukrainian escorts.,claim,[458],{}
477,"We call upon those responsible to ensure the safe treatment and immediate release of the team, and we urge Russia, itselfan OSCE member, to use its influence to ensure that this happens without further delay.",claim,"[459, 460]",{}
478,"On 17 April, talks between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union succeeded in agreeing steps to reduce tensions.",premise,[461],{}
479,The United Kingdom welcomed that agreement and the opportunity it offered for restoring stability in Ukraine.,claim,[462],{}
480,But this opportunity has been spurned.,claim,[463],{}
481,"Since 17 April, the actions undertaken by Kyiv and Moscow stand in stark contrast.",premise,[464],{}
482,Let us consider the facts.,premise,[465],{}
483,"First, the Geneva agreement called for all sides to refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative actions.",premise,[466],{}
484,"For its part, the Ukrainian Government has acted with commendable restraint when undertaking measured and proportionate security operations to deal with armed groups illegally occupying Government buildings and forming checkpoints.",claim,[467],{}
485,The Ukrainian Government has the right and responsibility to uphold the rule of law and protect both its citizens and its officials on Ukrainian territory.,premise,[468],{}
486,"Russia, on the other hand, continues its military manoeuvres and aggressive rhetoric.",claim,[469],{}
487,"Secondly, the agreement called for all illegal armed groups to be disarmed.",premise,[470],{}
488,The Ukrainian Government started to collect illegal weapons almost as soon as it came to power.,claim,[471],{}
489,There are now no illegally armed protesters on Maidan Square and no armed self-defence groups patrolling the streets of Kyiv.,premise,[472],{}
490,"But in Sloviansk and other eastern cities, we continue to see, encouraged by Russia, heavily armed paramilitary forces armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.",claim,[473],{}
491,"Thirdly, the agreement called for all illegally seized buildings, occupied streets and public places to be vacated.",premise,[474],{}
492,The Ukrainian Government has been systematically and incrementally removing barricades around the Maidan and the protests there are gradually shrinking.,claim,[475],{}
493,"By contrast, Russia has refused to use its influence to restrain armed groups in the east.",claim,[476],{}
494,"In fact, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated on 23 April that Russia will not call for these illegal militias to put down their arms and vacate buildings.",premise,[477],{}
495,"Instead, barricades and roadblocks in eastern and southern Ukraine have been steadily reinforced.",claim,[478],{}
496,"Furthermore, while Ukraine has put a draft law to the Ukrainian Parliament that would provide amnesty for protestors who vacate Government buildings and lay down their weapons, Russia has not rescinded the order by the Russian Parliament to authorize the use of military force in Ukraine and will not condemn the widely reported abuses by pro-Russian armed groups in southern and eastern Ukraine.",claim,"[479, 480]","{(480, 479): 'attack', (480, 481): 'support', (480, 482): 'support'}"
497,"These abuses include at least 11 kidnappings, among them several Ukrainian and international journalists, and the torture and murder ofa Ukrainian local official and two other local people.",premise,[481],{}
498,The deplorable shooting yesterday of the Mayor of Kharkiv was another sign of the violence being instigated against those who have opted to support a united Ukraine.,premise,[482],{}
499,"Finally, Ukraine has begun an inclusive process of constitutional reform on the decentralization of power.",claim,[483],{}
500,"It has announced measures to guarantee the protection of the Russian language, and it has condemned instances of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, whereas Russian rhetoric continues to whip up tensions with false claims that the Russian language is under threat in Ukraine and allegations that the Kyiv Government is anti-Semitic.",claim,"[484, 485]","{(485, 484): 'attack', (485, 486): 'support'}"
501,"When one lays out the facts, they cut through the fiction of Russian propaganda.",premise,[486],{}
502,"Having illegally annexed Crimea, Russia is now destabilizing southern and eastern Ukraine as part of its plan to undermine the ability of the people of Ukraine to determine peacefully their own future.",premise,[487],{}
503,"In doing so, it is threatening international peace and security.",claim,[488],{}
504,But the doors of diplomacy remain open.,premise,[489],{}
505,We urge Russia to abandon the dangerous course it is pursuing and to take urgent steps to implement the Geneva agreement.,claim,[490],{}
506,"In the extremely difficult circumstances which now confront it, the Ukrainian Government is striving to take forward a programme of democratization and inclusive constitutional and economic reform that aims to correct the long period of misgovernment and corruption that preceded it.",claim,"[491, 492]","{(492, 491): 'support'}"
507,It is in all our interests to support this process.,claim,[493],{}
508,This is not about zero-sum game politics; it is about restoring stability to Ukraine and to the wider region and allowing all the people of Ukraine to determine their own future.,premise,"[494, 495]",{}
509,We urge Russia to become part of this collective international effort.,claim,[496],{}
510,I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing.,non-arg,[],{}
511,"Since early April, the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated continuously.",claim,[497],{}
512,"In several eastern cities, armed militants, acting in a professional and synchronized manner, have taken possession of public buildings.",premise,[498],{}
513,The similarity of the operations that were observed in Crimea is striking.,claim,[499],{}
514,The violence continues.,claim,[500],{}
515,Seven observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage on 25 April.,premise,[501],{}
516,They must be released without delay.,claim,[502],{}
517,"On Sunday, the mayor of Kharkiv was the target of an attack and is in a serious condition.",premise,[503],{}
518,"We are witnessing a a subversive operation that has been planned, barely disguised and orchestrated by Russia.",claim,[504],{}
519,Russian special forces do not even hide anymore.,claim,[505],{}
520,"Some time ago, our Russian colleague denied their involvement in Crimea, while his President recognized it a few days later.",premise,[506],{}
521,"No doubt, he will do the same with respect to current events in Ukraine.",claim,[507],{}
522,France strongly and unequivocally condemns those unacceptable attempts by Russia to destabilize Ukraine.,claim,[508],{}
523,We must halt this course of confrontation and work towards de-escalation.,claim,[509],{}
524,"The joint declaration agreed on in Geneva on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union shows the way forward.",premise,[510],{}
525,It calls on all parties to refrain from violence and acts of intimidation or provocation.,premise,[511],{}
526,"It provides for the disarmament of illegal armed groups, evacuation of occupied buildings and public places and amnesty for those who lay down their arms, with the exception of individuals with blood on their hands.",premise,[512],{}
527,"It is essential that the declaration be implemented by all parties without delay and in good faith, so that the Ukrainian State can re-establish its sovereignty over its territory.",claim,"[513, 514]","{(513, 514): 'support'}"
528,"The OSCE's special monitoring mission has been asked to play an important role in implementing those de-escalation measures, and it is essential that it be allowed to act without hindrance.",premise,"[515, 516]","{(516, 515): 'support'}"
529,"However, since the declaration's adoption we have seen two distinct attitudes.",claim,[517],{}
530,"On the one hand, the Ukrainian Government has shown its good faith in implementing the declaration by drafting an amnesty law, launching the process of constitutional reform and accelerating the dismantling of barricades and armed groups in Kyiv.",premise,[518],{}
531,"In that regard, I commend the restraint and composure of the Ukrainian security forces, who have responded appropriately to the repeated destabilizing actions they are dealing with.",claim,[519],{}
532,We can only imagine what any other Government would have done in the face of such provocation on its national territory.,premise,[520],{}
533,"On the other hand, the Russian side has complied with none of the 17 April commitments.",claim,[521],{}
534,There has been no condemnation of the separatist actions that have spawned new violence and no call for public buildings to be evacuated.,premise,[522],{}
535,"There has been no appeal to the pro-Russian militants to exercise restraint and end their attacks on munitions depots and on their compatriots, some of whom are said to have been tortured, and on journalists as well.",premise,[523],{}
536,"Far from condemning those who took the OSCE observers hostage, today Russia is calling the mission's presence in eastern Ukraine a provocation.",premise,[524],{}
537,"However, we sincerely hope that the announcement yesterday of a halt to the Russian military manoeuvres on the Ukrainian border is true and will be the first step in a genuine de-escalation.",non-arg,[],{}
538,We are at a turning point.,claim,[525],{}
539,"With every moment that passes, the risk of anarchy and bloody incidents grows.",premise,[526],{}
540,That is why we call on the Russian authorities to choose the path of de-escalation through the immediate demonstration of respect for the commitments made in the Geneva declaration.,claim,[527],{}
541,"Yesterday, together with our European Union partners and the United States, we adopted new targeted sanctions.",non-arg,[],{}
542,"If the situation worsens, we will be forced to ratchet up the sanctions once again.",premise,[528],{}
543,That is not what we would prefer.,claim,[529],{}
544,"Our goal is to ensure the holding on 25 May of free, inclusive and transparent presidential elections, whose good conduct will be guaranteed by the presence of international observers.",claim,[530],{}
545,The possibility that the actions of some violent groups could threaten the holding of this democratic exercise is unacceptable.,claim,[531],{}
546,We also support constitutional reform that would ensure respect for minorities and some decentralization.,claim,[532],{}
547,It is up to all Ukrainians to decide their future.,premise,[533],{}
548,"Then history and geography can bring about an inevitable and desirable reconciliation between a democratic, peaceful and independent Ukraine and a Russian Federation that will renounce its dangerous nationalist illusions.",claim,[534],{}
549,"I would like to thank you, Madam President, for convening this emergency meeting on Ukraine, and Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing on the developments in the situation in eastern Ukraine.",non-arg,[],{}
550,"We believe, however, that the Ukrainian people and the international community will not judge us on the number of public briefings we organize in the Council or the toughness of our statements, but on our political will and how we use our influence to effectively help Ukrainians resolve the crisis in their country.",claim,[535],{}
551,We are witnessing a situation that is deteriorating every day and leading slowly to an open war that might involve countries of the region and beyond.,claim,[536],{}
552,"Indeed, the developments of the last few weeks are alarming and have immensely undermined the diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation.",premise,[537],{}
553,"We condemn in the strongest terms the attempt made to assassinate Hennadiy Kernes, the Mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as well as the illegal detention of the military monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and their Ukrainian staff, which is a serious violation of the current agreement, and we demand their immediate release.",claim,[538],{}
554,"While we welcome the joint de-escalation measures agreed on in Geneva on 17 April and involving the main stakeholders as a step towards a tangible solution to the crisis, we are concerned about the fact that many of those measures have not been implemented.",claim,[539],{}
555,"We urge all parties to implement their parts of the agreement, and especially to disarm all military groups and restore all seized buildings.",claim,[540],{}
556,"The OSCE monitors must be allowed to play a role and to fulfil their mandate, as stipulated in the joint declaration.",claim,[541],{}
557,"In the meantime, Rwanda reiterates its call for respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.",claim,[542],{}
558,"We believe in the right to peaceful demonstration, but we firmly condemn the use of violence, the seizure of public buildings and the installation of illegal checkpoints by armed protesters.",claim,[543],{}
559,"We therefore believe that Ukraine, like any other country, has a right to restore public order, provided that right is exercised in a proportionate manner.",claim,[544],{}
560,"Nonetheless, the crisis in eastern Ukraine is not merely a matter of public order but a political issue that must be resolved through genuine dialogue with all Ukrainian parties, with a view to ensuring sustainable peace and equal rights for all, including the Russian-speaking minority.",claim,[545],{}
561,"To conclude, we reiterate our strong belief that while public meetings of the Council are important for its members to continue monitoring this crisis, the only way to solve the crisis in Ukraine is through the exercise of political will and the influence of all the countries and regional organizations involved, in order to ensure a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict.",claim,[546],{}
562,I would like to thank Mr. Feltman for his update on the difficult situation in Ukraine.,non-arg,[],{}
563,"I am wondering, and I would also like to ask the Council, why we are having this meeting.",non-arg,[],{}
564,"Going over the difficult situation and the worsening of the crisis once again is undoubtedly one reason, although I know there are clear, decisive reasons behind the initiative of the United Kingdom to convene this meeting that brings us all together.",claim,[547],{}
565,"I also ask myself another question, not out of false piety but out of sincerity.",non-arg,[],{}
566,It is the question Pope Francis asked a few days ago when he received Mr. Yatsenyuk - who has not sped up hatred and violence - and gave him a pen with which he might sign a peace.,non-arg,[],{}
567,Are we acting in the Council to help overcome misunderstandings?,non-arg,[],{}
568,I am certain that we are.,non-arg,[],{}
569,It is for that reason that today my country will merely reaffirm two convictions.,non-arg,[],{}
570,"That is, that in the dialogue of constructive diplomacy that was initiated on 17 April with a view to finding a peaceful and political solution to this critical situation, Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine all expressed at Geneva a willingness to reach an agreement.",claim,[548],{}
571,"What we saw as willingness to agree, the whole world saw as a source of hope.",premise,[549],{}
572,"Today, however, we must urge the parties to return to a constructive dialogue.",claim,[550],{}
573,The difficult situation facing Ukraine cannot be resolved through unilateral actions of any sort.,premise,[551],{}

618,What we have not seen is a single positive step by Russia to fulfil its Geneva commitments.,claim,[588],{}

1389,The one thing that is essential is that the agreement be fulfilled.,claim,[1310],{}

1399,What bothered me more than anything today was how calmly and approvingly our Western colleagues spoke about the search operations that the Kyiv authorities are now carrying out in eastern Ukraine.,premise,[1320],{}
1400,"They gave the impression that they know what the Kyiv authorities are thinking, what their plans are.",premise,[1321],{}
1401,"Maybe they had a part in drawing up those plans, and that was why they talked about what was going on so calmly.",claim,[1322],{}
1402,"Perhaps that should not be so surprising after all, because, as we know, every visit to Kyiv by senior American officials has resulted in events reaching new levels of confrontation, and a more violent turn of events.",premise,[1323],{}
1403,"In that regard, it is not surprising that the United States, as I said in my statement, did not want the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to do as it was supposed to under the Vienna Document, that is, to bring about dialogue and organize a round table with representative of different regions and the Kyiv Government.",claim,[1324],{}

1418,"First, for the Russians to blame Ukraine for Ukraine's actions in defence of its own people on its own territory really is starting to remind me of the story of the schoolboy who returned home with his nose bloody and his shirt torn and, asked by his mother how the fight started, he said ""it started when the other boy hit me back"".",premise,[1339],{}

1421,"People in this Chamber have heard many times, including just now, that the United States and other countries never called oon protesters in the Maidan to leave buildings or avoid violence.",premise,[1343],{}
1422,The implication is that we are holding Russian separatists to a different standard.,claim,[1344],{}
1423,That is a claim that has been made in almost every meeting we have had.,premise,[1345],{}
1424,I would just like to correct the record.,non-arg,[],{}

1428,"On 24 January, when protesters occupied some regional administration buildings, we reiterated our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property.",premise,[1349],{}
1429,"On 27 January, we made clear that we condemned the use of violence to seize Government buildings, such as the takeover of a Ministry of Justice building that took place over the past cople of days and of a public exhibition hall that weekend, and continued to reiterate our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property.",premise,"[1350, 1351]",{}

1431,What is more important now is where we go from here.,claim,[1354],{}
1432,What I would ask my Russian colleague is whether Russia will make public statements and work privately behind the scenes to urge Russian separatists to negotiate peacefully their departure from public buildings.,premise,[1355],{}
1433,Where does Russia assess that Russian separatists who claim loyalty to the Russian Government and who wear uniforms just like those of Russian soldiers obtained weapons and training capable of shooting down Ukrainian helicopters?,premise,[1356],{}
1434,"Finally, Russia repeatedly takes aim at the so-called illegitimate Government in Kyiv but refuses to acknowledge ever, in any meeting, that it did not embrace the 21 February agreement when it was negotiated.",claim,[1357],{}
1435,"We have a golden opportunity on 25 May for the people of eastern Ukraine to have their voices heard, for them to choose their own leaders and for us to get to a universally legitimate Government that is respected and chosen by all of the people of Ukraine.",premise,[1358],{}
1436,"Yet Russia will not come out in support of the elections and work with us to ensure that they take place - which would be the best way of ensuring rights, representativeness and greater autonomy for the people of eastern Ukraine.",premise,"[1359, 1360]","{(1359, 1358): 'attack', (1359, 1360): 'attack'}"

1438,That is what we have just heard from my American colleague.,non-arg,[],{}
1439,"What we have heard from Washington, DC, and the way it was heard clearly demonstrated to all - including to those in Kyiv, which is most important - that the United States looked favourably on the forceful change of power, which did not ultimately serve the interests of the Ukrainian people.",premise,"[1361, 1362]","{(1362, 1361): 'support'}"
1440,Regarding my proposal.,non-arg,[],{}
1441,"1 do think it would be good to conclude this meeting with such a statement, not asking every delegation what it is going to declare but rather make ajoint statement calling for a swift halt to all violence.",claim,[1363],{}

1466,We have to ask searching questions about why we are now confronting this tragic situation.,claim,[1382],{}
1467,Russian officials have claimed that armed separatists in eastern Ukraine represent a spontaneous local insurgency.,premise,[1383],{}
